- **npm** or **yarn** - package manager for frontend
- **Poetry** - dependency manager for backend (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd lifestyle_tracker
   ```

2. **Set up the Frontend**
   ```bash

   # Install dependencies
   poetry install
   ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### Development Mode

1. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   poetry run python app.py
   ```
   The Flask server will start on `http://localhost:5000`

2. **Start the Frontend Development Server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   The Next.js application will start on `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Access the Application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### Production Build

1. **Build the Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run the Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   poetry run python app.py
   ```

###  GENERAL THOUGHTS THROUGHOUT

- STAGE 2: Best way to store NHS No and/or Age in order to use the patient info on the scoring matrix. Settled on a session instead of local storage so that it persisted each refresh. In production, I would move to a token-based approach instead, because Flask sessions are usually cookie-based and can be manipulated unless secured properly.

- UNIT TESTING: Unit tests may break in the future if patient age falls outside of a banding dynamically. Future fix to work around this.
